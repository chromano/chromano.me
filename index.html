    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p><img src="/images/photo.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:5px;">I am a software developer with <strong>10+ years of experience</strong> in end-to-end application
design and development. Iâ€™m always <strong>looking for challenging projects</strong> where I can
apply my extensive knowledge of technologies and methodologies. My mother
tongue is Portuguese, but I am fluent in written English and proficient in
spoken English as well.</p>
    <p>My primary focus and experience is with <strong>WEB development</strong>, especially backend
systems. In addition, I have a great interest and competency in the development
of rich user interfaces using the latest browser and javascript-related
technologies, as well as webscale database and server configuration /
optimization.</p>
