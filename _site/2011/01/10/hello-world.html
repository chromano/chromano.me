<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p class="meta">18 Oct 2008 &#8211; San Francisco</p>
<p>2008 is a leap year. That means that three hundred and sixty six days ago, almost to the minute, I was sitting alone in a booth at Zeke&#8217;s Sports Bar and Grill on 3rd Street in San Francisco. I wouldn&#8217;t normally hang out at a sports bar, let alone a sports bar in <span class="caps">SOMA</span>, but back then Thursday was &#8220;I Can Has Ruby&#8221; night. I guess back then &#8220;I can has _______&#8221; was also a reasonable moniker to attach to pretty much anything. <span class="caps">ICHR</span> was a semi-private meeting of like minded Ruby Hackers that generally and willingly devolved into late night drinking sessions. Normally these nights would fade away like my hangover the next morning, but this night was different. This was the night that <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> was born.</p>
<p>I think I was sitting at the booth alone because I&#8217;d just ordered a fresh Fat Tire and needed a short break from the socializing that was happening over at the long tables in the dimly lit aft portion of the bar. On the fifth or sixth sip, Chris Wanstrath walked in. I have trouble remembering now if I&#8217;d even classify Chris and I as &#8220;friends&#8221; at the time. We knew each other through Ruby meetups and conferences, but only casually. Like a mutual &#8220;hey, I think your code is awesome&#8221; kind of thing. I&#8217;m not sure what made me do it, but I gestured him over to the booth and said &#8220;dude, check this out.&#8221; About a week earlier I&#8217;d started work on a project called <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/grit">Grit</a> that allowed me to access Git repositories in an object oriented manner via Ruby code. Chris was one of only a handful of Rubyists at the time that was starting to become serious about Git. He sat down and I started showing him what I had. It wasn&#8217;t much, but it was enough to see that it had sparked something in Chris. Sensing this, I launched into my half-baked idea for some sort of website that acted as hub for coders to share their Git repositories. I even had a name: GitHub. I may be paraphrasing, but his response was along the lines of a very emphatic &#8220;I&#8217;m in. Let&#8217;s do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The next night, Friday, October 19, 2007 at 10:24pm Chris made the first commit to the GitHub repository and sealed in digital stone the beginning of our joint venture. There were, so far, no agreements of any kind regarding how things would proceed. Just two guys that decided to hack together on something that sounded cool.</p>
