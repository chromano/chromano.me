            <h1>Sony Bravia TV comes with Linux</h1>
<p>What was my surprise when I discovered Sony’s Bravia TVs came with Linux! My first action was to search for the source code and then I found <a href="http://www.sony.net/Products/Linux/TV/KDL-46NX705.html">this page</a>. Interesting, isn’t it? I’m wondering now how can I make my own changes and build a firmware package to update the original one :)</p>
<p>What else can I write about the TV? It is almost perfect (it doesn’t work very well with the standard definition supplied by the cable TV provider, though).</p>
<p>The TV also has support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance"><span class="caps">DLNA</span></a>, but the thing here is that I didn’t find any good media server out there. I mean, <a href="http://www.isedora.com/">iSedora</a> is pretty cool, but it doesn’t support transcoding of videos with subtitles, also you’ve to pay for use it — unless your videos has less than 1 hour of duration :)</p>
