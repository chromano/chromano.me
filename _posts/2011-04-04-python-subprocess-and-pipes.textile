h1. {{ page.title }}

So, have you ever tried to make commands/applications communicate through pipes using Python’s subprocess module? How would you do? I just used the following and I’m posting it here since I didn’t find anything on the internet:

{% highlight python %}
import subprocess

dump_proc = subprocess.Popen(["pg_dump", "-d dbname", "-h localhost"],
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
bzip_proc = subprocess.Popen(["bzip2"], stdin=dump_proc.stdout,
    stdout=open("db_backup.bz2", "wb"))
{% endhighlight %}

Cool isn’t it? Bye!
