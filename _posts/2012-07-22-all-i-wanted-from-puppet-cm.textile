title: All I wanted from Puppet CM
---
h1. {{ page.title }}

A small project is what I wanted to deploy. I don't know puppet well enough (I think), but I wanted to check it out and try to deploy this project using it, after all I thought that it was something about the below:

{% highlight ruby %}
service {:nginx
    ensure => running
}

service {:mongodb
    ensure => running
}

project {:project
    path => /var/www/project
    git_repo => git://foo
}

service {:gunicorn
    ensure => running
    app_path => /var/www/project/
    wsgi_app => main:app
}
{% endhighlight %}

But no, it *HAD* to be so unbelievable hard. So hard that I decided to give it up and set up the server myself. Everything is working now, but I stil wonder: _Why so hard?_

I bet you can understand what I want to accomplish with the paste above, but why puppet can't? Anyways, this is just a post to think about the problem and to record my frustration with puppet.  I will probably write another blog post in response to this one, since I'm still not conformed.
