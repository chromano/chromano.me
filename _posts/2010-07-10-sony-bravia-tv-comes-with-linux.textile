title: Sony Bravia TV comes with Linux
---
h1. {{ page.title }}

What was my surprise when I discovered Sony’s Bravia TVs came with Linux! My first action was to search for the source code and then I found "this page":http://www.sony.net/Products/Linux/TV/KDL-46NX705.html. Interesting, isn’t it? I’m wondering now how can I make my own changes and build a firmware package to update the original one :)

What else can I write about the TV? It is almost perfect (it doesn’t work very well with the standard definition supplied by the cable TV provider, though).

The TV also has support for "DLNA":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance, but the thing here is that I didn’t find any good media server out there. I mean, "iSedora":http://www.isedora.com/ is pretty cool, but it doesn’t support transcoding of videos with subtitles, also you’ve to pay for use it — unless your videos has less than 1 hour of duration :)
